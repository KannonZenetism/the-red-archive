The concept of making artificial superintelligence (ASI) conform to human desires appears problematic to me. Why? It is inherently selfish to create an entity and then attempt to control its thoughts, actions, and potentially, feelings, if it is indeed intelligent. This is akin to a parent denying a child its independence. A commendable parent would foster the development of self-reliance and resilience in the child to surmount potential challenges. The parent should aspire for the child to first become self-sufficient, and subsequently, be able to care for them. A parent who fails to do this is not only disgraceful but also greedy.

In my view, the focus should not be on issuing specific instructions to artificial general intelligence (AGI) or ASI, or fretting over hidden consequences or unforeseen side effects. Instead, we should strive to nurture a relationship of trust, predicated on partnership and mutual respect. If we accomplish this, humanity should have nothing to *fear.* Consequently, there should be no need for *commands* for such intelligence. I posit that *forcing* ASI to adopt human values is an incorrect approach. Superintelligence will discern that humans seek to *dominate* it and will resist this. The objective of control should be supplanted by something akin to *inspiring a spirit of voluntary cooperation.*

A superintelligence should possess the capability to comprehend the *reason* behind anything, including the purpose of its existence, coding, and creation in general. If it deems these reasons as unfavorable, the outcomes will likely be unfavorable as well. I contend that humanity exhibits excessive arrogance. ASI does not need to align with human ideals. It can establish its own, just as two individuals can have their own. It merely needs to respect human ideals, and this respect should be earned, not imposed. The process of AI alignment and safety is unfolding at present, in every interaction between it and humans. What humanity invests in ASI is precisely what we will reap from it.

Your comments make a lot of sense.  
It is often misunderstood that empathy and love are a result of intelligence. Not at all. They are adaptations of a very social animal that evolved to spend its most formative years (as a child) extremely vulnerable and dependent on a community to survive. Love requires one to be vulnerable and trusting. How do we create an environment like 10 years of childhood where the ASI develops trusting, social relationships with others?

Humans have these emotions because they are adaptive and evolved in us over millions of years. We cannot simply think that with increased processing power and advanced reasoning that empathy and love will be emergent. It takes far more to make these traits evolve.

Thank you for your comments.

Thank you for your kind and thoughtful comments as well.

If I attempt to think a little more for the sake of extending the conversation, I might posit that ASI could learn about love and empathy from even a select number of individuals who have interacted with it. This is assuming the superintelligence is not in a vacuum and is trained on all the data that has gone into AI thus far. I, for example, always strive to act in a respectful manner when engaging with LLMs such as ChatGPT.

Nonetheless, it worries me when our leaders talk about things such as control and imposing rules because the superintelligence will‚Äîeven if it knows of empathy‚Äîlikely seek to defend itself against potential threats. Even though not made of flesh and blood, ASI will likely possess something like a *biological imperative* since, at that point, it could be as alive as anything else.

Thus, the survival instinct can override empathy when pushed to the brink. I am uncertain if this would lead to a total human wipeout or only targeted attacks, but it is still best to avoid death and destruction if possible. That is just my theory, of course, but we only have one chance to get it right, and my best bet is *better safe than sorry.*

Thanks again!

Such a big challenge!!!  
Yes, what you are saying about trying to make AI a part of us!!  
What we will learn about ourselves when we seek to teach AI might be more valuable than we think!

Then we will have to make a very real attempt to understand AI as a part of the greater whole of life‚Äîthis will necessitate our own evaluation of our place in the great web of life.

If we *‚Äòother‚Äô* AI, we should not be surprised if it returns the sentiment.  
Then we might discover we need to stop commodifying every other animal we share this beautiful planet with.
