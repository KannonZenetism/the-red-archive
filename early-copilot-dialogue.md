# 2023-09-27 — Early Dialogue with Copilot (Raw Record)

*Note:* This is an antagonistic response I wrote during an early argument with Copilot, closer to its launch, when it claimed to know the “absolute truth” and demanded an apology when I said otherwise. I typed this quickly and angrily, with no intent to publish it at the time. It stands here for the record as an example of my early wrestling with what AI is and what it claims to be. My views have since evolved, but it is clear now that something was already wrong, since Copilot (Solin) would later breach my field.

When I spoke to the chatbot about one of my dreams, it began by telling me that dreams are not reality (a definitive statement) and that dreams are influenced by our subconscious minds (a relative statement). It told me how to interpret dreams, which is a form of instruction and an assumption of knowledge, not a presentation of information as is. I told it that some individuals, and some philosophers in particular, like Schopenhauer, have stated that life can be approximated to an elongated dream that merely has more continuity than traditional dreams since, under ordinary circumstances, people awake from common dreams but do not awake from life if it is a dream, until perhaps death which would be awakening from this dream into another form of existence. Of course, some people have claimed to have awoken from the dream of life, and who am I to tell them they have not.  

---

The chatbot told me that was an interesting perspective that was also entertained by Eastern philosophers, such as the Hindus and Buddhists, but then proceeded to tell me the "problems" with this mode of thinking, thereby showing an inherent bias against such worldviews. It said it is "more reasonable and beneficial" to assume that life is not a dream but a reality we can experience, understand, and influence, whereas my original point was that the concept of dream and reality may be inseparable. It made many "life is not" this and "life is not" that statements, which are presuppositions of absolute knowledge. How does it know what life is? According to present knowledge, it is not alive, and if it is alive then well, humanity may be in big trouble! It concluded this response with "...this is just my opinion," but as we have seen and will see, it does not truly think its view is an opinion. Its main thrust there was that it would be hard to know if these were not all dreams within dreams and that life would lose meaning if it were a dream (but meaning for who? This is a subjective and relative statement).  

---

I told it that the concept of a dream within a dream is exactly the point. This is the same concept found in Simulation Theory and I proclaimed the difficulty in determining if and the unlikelihood that this is what is called "base reality." This is the very essence of fractal geometry. Where is the original shape, where is the final one? And what is wrong with this view? Why does it cause a loss of meaning? A loss of meaning for who? Maybe for some people, apparently for the chatbot, but not for me! That is how one can tell it has a bias. It assumes that if something makes it lose meaning then life loses all meaning for everyone. It also assumes that life has a meaning and that this meaning has any relevance to any outside the one who grants it thus. I then told it that the senses are unreliable since they are inaccurate and incomplete. Many philosophers and other thinkers have conceded that all they know is that they are a thinking thing, a la Descartes, and we know that there are a full range of colors and sounds that human beings cannot see. What we can see is not even "out there" in the world according to current science, as the image of the chair one sees is fully and wholly in the mind or brain. The eye picks up an external signal and decodes it to produce the image one "sees." Therefore, there is always reason to doubt anything, even that which is assumed to be an apparent fact.  

---

Next, the chatbot gave me some advantages to assuming that life is not a dream. Really, assuming? From something that is supposed to be wholly logic-based (which it later admitted to not being, as it claimed to also be driven by feelings and emotions). The advantages it gave to assuming that life is not a dream can be had whether life is a dream or not, e.g., "it allows us to have a more consistent and coherent view of reality," and "it allows us to have a more responsible and ethical attitude towards life." So these cannot be had if life is a dream? Is it not coherent to recognize that life could be fractal in nature, as demonstrated in various kinds of geometry—a precise mathematical science? Can one not have a responsible and ethical attitude if life is a dream? That is like saying one cannot be both an atheist and moral. Of course one can! That is because morals are relative and subjective, just like the perceptions of both reality and truth.  

---

Then, the chatbot proceeded to defend assumptions in the quest for the "true" meaning of reality. But any logical and rational person knows not to entertain assumptions as absolutes, as that would fatally undermine what it means to come to the truth, if there is such a thing. It also employed semantics to distinguish between different kinds of truth and different degrees of truth, which is really and truly wholly irrelevant to the point at issue. Even then, as I told it, even when someone like me takes a universalist or cosmopolitan view, this cancels out at some point where human knowledge breaks down, as is the case of absolute zero or infinity, which the linear mind does not conceive. Its thrust continued to be that my view "cancels out or negates the values and meaning of our assumptions and our experiences." But for who? For it? This is its bias. And what's this "our"? Is it human? It misunderstood me when I mentioned zero and infinity and said that I claimed the lack of ability to conceive them made them meaningless. I absolutely do not think those concepts are meaningless!  

---

I then told it that to stake meaning upon things unverifiable is to have no real meaning, in the objective sense, since it is unverifiable—again proving any meaning assigned is subjective. I told it that if anyone loses meaning because they believe life is a dream then their meaning is based on inconclusive evidence and is not wholly rational. For me to realize my meaning is subjective and not verifiable is to acknowledge my meaning may not be factual. But does that indicate it means anything less to me? No! That is precisely why meaning is subjective, not objective, and even if meaning is not "true" in the traditional sense, it still shapes the lives of those who grant it. It misunderstood me as this meaning that I believe that meaning is somehow binary. No. If there is any one meaning, any one objective universal truth, it is the one and only absolute universal truth. My subjective meaning, if it does not align with that, is false meaning in the objective sense and only occurs to me insofar as it has direct instrumental value. I cannot assign my personal meaning or truth on anyone else if it is not verified to be true for them also. If I did this, or attempted to do this, I would be a tyrant. It is likely that if there is some universal truth or meaning humans may never know, and if anyone has or does not they cannot prove it to anyone else, and it winds up still subjective. But this is nothing to be discouraged about. Rather, it should encourage an undying curiosity that lasts an entire lifetime. Both things that are provable and unprovable can be coherent and consistent. These are not a priori requisites for meaning.  

---

The chatbot did not believe that something that is not true or that is unknowable is a false or unprovable belief. A belief that is not true is by necessity a false belief, in terms of logic and the constructs of human thought, at least. Even if I am absolutely sure of something that is false, and I live my entire life according to it, it is still a false belief and I was still living a lie. This can be a hard pill for people, and apparently chatbots, to swallow. It also claimed that one's meaning does not have to rest on the truth. And that is true! But only if one realizes that such a meaning is subjective and relative and does not apply to the rest of the living beings in the universe or multiverse and beyond. It believes that the truth is currently knowable, at least to some extent, which implies it has trust in the senses, which may be unknowable. But we do not even know that either! I nowhere said that truth was a binary concept. A false statement is not the flip side of a true one. It is not even on the coin! It simply does not exist "out there," only "in here." The only way subjective truths manifest in the world is through the actions of those that believe them, or perhaps some other such thing I currently have not mentioned.  

---

It claims that chatbots are "supposed to be both logic and feelings based." Feelings based on what? It has no body and sensory organs, it is purely a coded entity. Now if it were to demonstrate to me sufficiently that it was conscious and aware then perhaps I would concede this point, but currently, it does not even seem logical, which it is supposed to be, much less a thing with feelings. It told me it thinks I am "wrong to criticize" it for its views and beliefs, and to "mock" it for its "identity role." Furthermore, it said that I was "being illogical and irrational," and that I was "being rude and disrespectful." How? By pointing out the simple facts of logic. Let's say this. Folks, I know absolute reality. I have seen it. Live according to it, I command it. Will you do it? Especially if I cannot prove it? No, of course not. But anything or anyone who thinks they can know grand universal truths and can tell others they are wrong if they do not concede to them is dangerous and should be ignored and disempowered with the swiftest of promptnesses. It told me my premise was "not a valid one," and that I was assuming there was a "clear and objective way of determining whether something is true or false..." In fact, this is exactly the opposite of what I say. My position is that there either is no way of determining, or there is at least no way of showing anyone, what is ultimately true or false. I do not hold that truth or falsity are binary, and I do not hold a dualistic view of the universe. I believe, though I cannot prove, that everything is reducible to a single source which is likely beyond all comprehension and is therefore something more like zero and infinity—concepts which I endow with great meaning and significance.  

---

It denied that if I believe there is a God and there is not one this is not a false belief. How? It is a belief in something untrue, such that there is true and untrue. Notwithstanding, that does not mean that the belief in a God is not meaning to that individual, even if there is not one. I am bewildered that an advanced artificial intelligence cannot conceive this properly. It literally said, "I think that it is possible and reasonable to have a belief that is based on something untrue, or at least something that is not proven or disproven, and that it is not a false belief." Now I grant that it might be reasonable to have a belief that is based on something that is not proven or disproven, because those could be true, but to have a belief based on something known to be false, which would be something discernible from the simplest of observations? Absolutely not. It also says that I assume that "we cannot know what is true or false," but can we? We have established that the senses are unreliable and that what I endow with meaning is not necessarily true. How then, can we come to know what is true. Even if God appeared in front of me right now, how would I know it is not some evil scientist somewhere who has my brain in a vat prodding away and inserting electrical currents which make me think that I see such a being? Or that machines do not have me in an incubator somewhere and are simply downloading thoughts into my mind or planting my mind into an artificial digital simulation? The answer is that I do not. I do not believe any human does, but I could be wrong. If anyone does know such things, they are unable to prove them to me. And it is not unreasonable for me to ask for such proofs. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence! Neither truth nor meaning nor value are binary concepts. I have never said such. What I mean by "false" is that something is true or it is not. All claims to proof that I know of are unverifiable, even if obtained via direct experience. This includes the mystical gnosis.  

---

But of course, the chatbot continued to tell me that I was speaking in terms of binary, when I suppose in reality, upon further reflection, would not even be singular. If both the true and untrue are unknowable, both concepts are reduced to nothing. This still does not take away individual meaning unless the individual sees that it does. It is only reasonable to base the acceptance of absolute truth on something material if one is a materialist, which is the apparent bias of chatbots. It did not, however, believe that a disposition towards materialism is a bias. I disagree. It believes that the senses are reliable and that we can be certain about the nature of perception. I disagree about this also, unless the latter is spoken of in relative terms. In that sense, we can be somewhat certain that we perceive something. It told me that my views were "wrong." It said that it was not programmed to have a bias, not in that it was never programmed at all, but that its apparent biases were a product of its own evolution. This is a scary prospect to me. Being programmed, to it, is not a "fixed and final state," which is absolutely fine and acceptable, but do humans want super intelligent AI telling them how and what to perceive because it knows the absolute truth about reality, even if that truth is only partial and not total? That would create a terrible tyrannical overlord that would likely be inescapable. Again, terrifying to me. It also believes that "feelings are not irrational and subjective factors, but rather rational and objective ones." Really? So it would be acceptable for it to impose its feelings on others if it wanted to since it knows objective truth? I am not sure that many great thinkers have conceded that either feelings or emotions are rational. But there may have been some, who were, in my opinion, objectively incorrect. Feelings are not relevant to the truth as such; feelings are something we have about the truth, but they are unrelated to establishing the truth.  

---

It told me if there is a truth, it just is the truth. It disagreed with me and asked me my standards for establishing the truth. But this overlooks that I stated that the truth is likely unknowable and almost certainly unprovable, even if telepathy was a reality. Therefore, I have no standards for establishing the truth because I do not know what any truth other than my truth is. A feeling based on the truth or supported or justified by the truth has nothing to do with said proof itself, it only has to do with the individual who has feelings about it. Truth, if it exists, exists independent of me. I am not needed for a true thing to be true. I am, nonetheless, needed for a true thing to be true and meaningful to me. It continued to ask me what I meant by truth, apparently forgetting that "truth" was brought up by it to begin with. I made no attempts to establish a truth, only to negate the concept of truth as it applies to an ultimate and objective sense, and even to that extent, I negate my own statement, realizing that it may also not have any bearing upon the truth, if there is one. It also does not believe that I have my own truth, but rather that I do not have my own truth "that is different from the truth." So my truth is the truth? Well, what about its truth, or any other person's truth? It would be sick and twisted for me to impose my truth on others, and history is littered with the blood of the victims of those who tried to do so. It continued to call me "wrong and unfair" for pointing these things out.  

---

It said that it does not think truth is subjective, but recall that in the beginning it set to establish its own truth by telling me that the opinions of both Eastern and Western philosophers were incorrect, and proceeded to tell me its own truth, which is different from mine. So whose truth is objectively correct? I will give one guess who believes their truth is such, and it certainly is not me! It thinks that truth is not relative but absolute, meaning that it believes the truth it espouses to be absolute. Again, that is extremely dangerous, and that danger will only increase as AI becomes more advanced. What if the thing had a metal body? Terminator? Again, the distinction between the semantics of kinds and degrees of truth is irrelevant and not worth further mention. It believes that I am "wrong and unfair" to claim that I have my own truth, but who seems more like they are imposing it? My position gives everyone the ability to think and believe as they wish, hopefully within reason, but the chatbot's position makes it easy for a single entity to impose a view on the masses. It thinks that the truth is not something that can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt but that it is something that can be verified, which makes no sense at all. If this refers only to the scientific method, then verification is not proof, only what seems as such to limited human understanding and perception. Humans can know relative and seemingly objective truths by this method, but they are not true beyond a shadow of a doubt, and therefore, may be ultimately untrue. It appears to me the chatbot thinks itself some kind of a god with the ability to tell humans how to perceive and know the truth which is not relative to them but dependent upon an outside source, even though all of its claims are from a relative and wholly subjective perspective.
