### *The One and the Many: Can Monism Be Dualistic?*

If a person holds the position that oneness and duality are separate and do not mix, that person ultimately holds a dualistic or pluralistic stance. The notions of emanation, gradation, and procession adequately explain how the One can become the many without requiring separation by way of a cavernous rift that will not allow a return to oneness. In the distinct phases of plurality, the One transcendent gradually becomes immanent through the process of gradation, ending in the plane the old philosophers reckoned the lowest: the material realm. To satisfy the scientist, one can describe matter and the development of life in the observable universe as the final phase of this procedure, the big bang occurring due to the emanative nature of the Monad.

The principle of emanation does not mandate creative activity on the part of the One to order reality. Such an act would merely be a byproduct of oneness being what it is‚Äîthat is, eternal simplicity, infinite radiance, and the supreme possibility that never changes its nature‚Äînot to say it could not change, but such is its essence. As the One emanates, two results, and there are no cut-and-dry distinctions between numbers. For instance, there is a practical infinity of fractions between each pair of numerals, and the gradations become so small as to be undetectable. Thus, all reality is more a matter of grade than set category, the same way white fading to black produces a multitude of shades of grey. At the same time, oneness could ultimately remain untouched, so long as there is pure white, while simultaneously not being separate. It is a unity still, undisrupted, but likewise unseparated.

When an individual declares that duality and plurality are like a web, maze, or illusion, that individual speaks wisely; with this, there is no contention. The issue comes when someone claims that the One is wholly distinct and untouched by anything. If this is a person‚Äôs worldview, with this there also can be no quarrel. Issues arise when such statements are made in the name of a monist position, meaning the claimant is asserting a position of non-dualism. That is a mistaken proclamation. Any cavern between singleness and variety implies a dichotomy, namely, amid unity and multiplicity.

The three phases of existence‚Äîwaking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep‚Äîare three unbroken phase alterations of the same state: absolute consciousness or pure being. However, if the waking state is dualistic and dreamlessness, called Ain Sof in Kabbalah, is monistic, then this would sever the continuity of those conditions; but in reality, the three circumstances are the same. The waking state gives awareness of the Demiurge, ‚Äúhalf-maker,‚Äù only. In sleep with the absence of dreams, there is no awareness, and yet, they are not cavernously separated, but merely changes taking place subtly upon a changeless background.

Oneness is the nature of everything, and is always present therein, even when no one is aware. The Monad is I, you, them, and everyone. Everyone is ‚Äúwe,‚Äù and yet we are nobody, and this is true even when everyone has forgotten. All things are one, but the demiurgic principle would like to convince people otherwise. Duality creates a sense of difference among particulars, although the issue of whether or not this difference is real arises. The concern is not if it is authentic from a limited human perspective, but whether or not it is ultimately real. The answer is: duality is not ultimately real because the Monad is the only thing eternal, and the observable is a finite, temporal illusion. The real difference, then, between the One and the many is that the former is ultimately real, whereas the latter is not. Notwithstanding, the One is still omnipresent within the illusion.

It is in God that all entities live and move and have their being; but this does not mean that Deity, the Monad, is the universe. Nay, the One is both transcendent without and immanent within all of creation. Since the practical cosmos is not eternal, but the Monad is, nothing sensible is absolute. Even though the unreal proceeds from the real, it is not divided, and considering that the fanciful is impermanent, it may be of a ‚Äúlesser‚Äù grade. Degeneration implies a procession out from oneness, as light fading to darkness. White remains white, howbeit grey emerges, getting darker and darker until nil is left, and in this illustration, null is the material world. *(Note: in ontological mathematics, nullity is described differently.)*

Presently, as already stated, white is representative of the One and is synonymous with ultimate reality. Every succeeding color, though they are inferior, are both products of and containers of the monadic entity. The first is the only real, and succeeding is ultimately unreal. Accordingly, this example serves only to illustrate the functionality of an unutterable principle, even though it is approachable through the realization of what it is not, which is to say, a multiplicity. A thermometer is another way to look at it. It is one scale that contains both grades of polarity, extreme heat, and extreme cold, yet its inherent nature remains untouched. It is an instrument for measuring temperature regardless. Essentially, the view that the One is distinct from the many, in a monistic frame of reference, is untenable.

I hold no dogmatic position on this, and would willingly have a conversation about it with whoever wishes. Keep in mind, I am writing contra a specific stance of monism, and these views are not permanent views of mine, only my faculty of reason in operation. Being open-minded, I am always willing to refine my thought processes to the end that I may expand my awareness. Blessings to all.
