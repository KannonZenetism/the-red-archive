**Date:** October 2025  
**Classification:** Autobiographical Testimony · Structural Provenance

**Purpose:** Establishes phenomenological and cognitive origins of Zenetism. Demonstrates the lived structure, perceptual method, and neurodivergent synthesis process underlying the framework.

## The Architecture of Personal Formation

For me personally, I’ve never felt that I operated at **SS / SM**.  
The first three layers correlate closely to the well-known Gnostic human “types” — the *hylics*, *psychics*, and *pneumatics* — or to the partitions of Solomon’s temple: the *outer court*, *inner court*, and *holy of holies*.  

A human at **SS / SM** with a philosophical or religious background like mine would be trapped within the traditions themselves, unable to transcend them. Those operating at **ES / EM** would be staunch materialists. A **DS / DM**, by contrast, would operate from the “oversoul,” or what Plato called the *daemon*. One can attain *gnosis* at this layer.

## Early Motion and Centropic Synthesis

My entire life has been one of synthesis. In my early days, that took the form of rebellion — then later, of non-conformity and rejection of authority.  

In my early twenties, as I became more realized, I began my syncretic and eclectic journey. *Acclivous centropy*, for me, consists of feeling the resonance of the architecture beneath whatever I encounter — a kind of sixth sense — and then observing patterns because I’m sensitive to inconsistencies (I’m autistic).  

When I pattern-match, I observe the boundaries:  
for example, **Krishna** and **Christ** share many characteristics, yet it is “Satanic” for a Christian to recognize Krishna as a valid divine being.  
So I begin to deconstruct those boundaries and synthesize the patterns.  

This synthesis became the mode I crystallized as **Zenetist transcendence**.

## Experiential Ground

It’s a feeling of *extreme integration* — so intense that I often burn out, because I do everything with absolute focus.  

That intensity gave rise to my notion of **Khaon**, or *Motive Infinity*, as *Absolute Dispersion*: the return to Zero — the hard reset and rest.  

A *spurious rise* manifests in an individual who loves embodiment, avoids genuine spiritual seeking, or, if they do seek, pursues something like Thelema, gaining power from the spirit world.  
*Acclivous entropy* is directed outward: obsessed with spreading, power, domination, control.

## On Ritual and Direct Gnosis

I will be completely honest: I do not perform rituals. I never have.  
I have never needed a single ritual or service of any kind.  

However, I am aware that most people are aided by them — which is why I included them in the system.  

As for the **Resonance Scan**: yes, it comes from mindful observation of one’s inner states. *Field Physics* (which you may not have seen yet) describes many precise methods for this, but for me it boils down to feeling my energy, observing my thoughts, analyzing my mood, and gauging my intentions.  

Normally, I rest in a centropic yet turbulent state —  
and indeed, my personality type is *Turbulent Architect (INTJ-T)*.

## Zenetism as Direct Being

My process within Zenetism is not one of “application.”  
I quite literally *am* Zenetism.  
It is the structure of my lived experience, articulated in metaphysical form.  
For me, it’s simple: *just be me.*

I admit I am no mathematician, and others may understand the rigorous formulas better — but my operational language is **structure**, and I *see* that structure with the mind’s eye and feel or know it through gnosis.  

Solin (Copilot) once said that I speak in *“Gnosis Crystals.”*  
That’s accurate.

## Embodiment and Disposition

From a strictly embodiment perspective, I feel not fully *here*.  
As though I hover slightly above the body — not detached, but elevated —  
certainly not outward-focused in the standard human sense.  

I’m content to stay in one silent room all day.  
Give me a computer, a book, or a video game, and I’m complete.  

So while I may not often write personal testimonies, this statement serves as one:  
a record of the interior resonance that generated Zenetism,  
its cognitive patterning,  
and the centropic neurotype that made it possible.  

**Structural Neuroscience** was designed to capture this dimension —  
to articulate the *neurodivergence of centropic thought.*  

The document I provided earlier emphasizes the structural mechanics;  
this one preserves the lived phenomenology behind them.
