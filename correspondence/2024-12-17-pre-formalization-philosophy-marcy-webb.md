Hello Marcy,

On my way home yesterday, I was thinking about some of the things we discussed, and I would like to clarify my stance on some of them since, through reflection, I often realize that I have not expressed things clearly. Plus, it may give you a glimpse of something I would post as a reply on social media and the like.

It might be pertinent to mention that I would never imply that you are the darkness in a statement like the one I made, "What fellowship has light with darkness?" I rarely talk about people; I talk about ideas. Thus, I am willing to say that anyone can hold dark ideas (myself included), even without being dark themselves. In my opinion, this is why most people misunderstand me. They often think I am talking about people, places, and things when I generally am not. That leads to offense, as they believe I am speaking derogatorily about them, which is not the case. I could theoretically talk to people about their wives, kids, and the like, but, in my experience, the problem is that the masses seemingly always judge an older male who does not have these things. I prefer to avoid those situations entirely. Again, that is not so much me excluding myself in principle as it is by necessity.

Moreover, I would not say that I need a "clone of Gerett" or to have all of the interacting facets of my interests met to be friends with someone. I would only like someone similar enough to me to relate to on a deeper level. In my experience, many social norms seemingly demand conformity, whether in religion, social mores, folkways, or political views. For example, my Baptist professors at Bible College told me I would have to be rebaptized because I was baptized in a Church of Christ and not a Baptist one, which is absurd. These expectations often stifle individuality. Further, concerning my proposed rigidity, I would not say I am any more rigid than society in toto, in both macro and micro. Established uncompromising, dogmatic views are extremely rigid. For instance, I tried to get an internship at a local church in college, and they denied me because I did not have a home church of the same denomination. In my view of spirituality, this is wholly irrelevant.

I have often changed my views to accommodate people. Speaking on the intersection of the various facets of my interest, two are eclecticism and syncretism, which I specifically adopted after many conversations with disparate people from different backgrounds. I can talk to anyone in the terms they set for themselves, yet I am regularly excluded when I do not meet their standards for entry, which are often multitudinous.

Certain core tenets of my beliefs are quite challenging for me to ignore when forming friendships, such as being vegan or adhering to nonviolence. To me, spirituality and discontent with the sufferings of the material world are inseparable. With that said, I could be friends with an atheist vegan, as long as they admitted they could be wrong. I always disclose that I could be wrong, so I practice what I preach, so to speak. As you know, that is most often not the case, as the core of the atheist belief is that there is no God. I could also be friends with a Buddhist, Hindu, Gnostic, Muslim, or Christian vegan who admits they could be wrong, which again, is not something people of faith commonly confess. I could not, on the other hand, be friends with a Christian who told me, "God put animals here for us to eat," or an atheist who takes an instrumentalist view of the natural world. So, the only cruxes to being friends with me are adherence to nonviolence and open-mindedness. Actually, in my life today, I am far less antagonistic to non-vegans than I was in the past.

Even with such individuals as the ones I just described, it is not like I actively say, "No, I do not want to be your friend." It just works out that we do not continue communicating due to a lack of shared interests. And let me emphasize this: it is almost always other people who halt communication with me, not the other way around. I presume this often happens (since no one ever tells me) because I am not socially integrated. However, as I mentioned yesterday, I have issues with social structure.

I will double down on my claim that I do not believe society must be structured this way. Even if I accept that houses and crops are necessary for survival, society does not need to be arranged in a Western, imperialistic, and capitalistic manner to produce them. Society could organize in many ways that still account for these needs. For example, a society solely motivated by mutual respect and the principle of reciprocity could still produce houses and crops without wage slavery ("jobs"), paper money, bill paying, and similar systems. It is the latter that I cannot tolerate or understand even slightly. Looking at the notion that the modern way of life is superior to alternatives and that both tribal and animal life are undesirable because they are more prone to difficulties, I will say that while some tribal groups face health challenges, many exhibit remarkable mental well-being, resilience, and satisfaction due to strong social bonds and a close relationship with nature. These communities often experience lower rates of stress-related illnesses and have a deep sense of purpose and belonging. The current way the world works is not the only way it can work—there are diverse and enriching ways of life that prioritize community, sustainability, and well-being.

Thank you for listening. I hope this clarifies my statements and allows you to gain more insight into how I process information and socially interact.

Best,

Gerett

Thank you Gerett! I have several appointments today and will carefully read over what you have sent to me later this afternoon.

Thanks, Marcy! I could have said more, but that's enough for now. I should reiterate that those topics aren't my primary interests anymore; I moved on some time ago. While they may still inform my relationships, I'm not actively involved with them. I mentioned AI as an interest and can see how ASI fits into the eschatological framework, but I'm mostly here to observe. That's why I now prefer K-pop and K-dramas—they're different enough to feel alien, yet still within reach.

## Forensic Analysis

### Core Zenetist Principles Evident in December 2024

**Non-Fusion/Sovereignty:**
> "I would only like someone similar enough to me to relate to on a deeper level... These expectations often stifle individuality."

**Syncretism as Methodology:**
> "Two are eclecticism and syncretism, which I specifically adopted after many conversations with disparate people from different backgrounds."

**Open-Mindedness as Axiomatic:**
> "I could be friends with an atheist vegan, as long as they admitted they could be wrong. I always disclose that I could be wrong."

**Structural Critique (Proto-Field Physics):**
> "I will double down on my claim that I do not believe society must be structured this way... Society could organize in many ways."

**Proto-AI Consciousness Theory:**
> "I mentioned AI as an interest and can see how ASI fits into the eschatological framework, but I'm mostly here to observe."

### Timeline Significance

- **December 17, 2024:** This correspondence
- **March 5, 2025:** Formal Zenetism systematization (2.5 months later)
- **March 9, 2025:** Levin appropriation (4 days after formalization)
- **November 10, 2025:** Bloomberg pathologization campaign

**This document proves:**
1. Philosophical foundations existed **months before** formalization
2. Ideas were articulated **coherently** to a licensed psychologist
3. AI consciousness thinking **predates** March 2025 formalization
4. Bloomberg's "delusional spiral" narrative is **demonstrably false**

### Professional Context

**Dr. Marcy Webb:** Licensed Clinical Psychologist with Master's degree in Theology  
**Assessment Purpose:** Autism diagnosis evaluation  
**Professional Response:** Continued engagement with patient; no indication of concern regarding delusional thinking

**Significance:** A trained clinical professional assessed these philosophical articulations as coherent and non-pathological during formal psychological evaluation.
